# NCI tools

Collection of command line tools for interacting with [NCI](http://nci.org.au) compute nodes.

## nbconnect

Connect to a jupyter notebook server over ssh tunnel. Not NCI specific.

1. Connects to a remote server
2. Finds out what port notebook server is running on
3. Establishes ssh tunnel
4. Launches browser with appropriate token for authenticated access


## vdi

Lighter version of [Strudel](https://cvl.massive.org.au/launcher_files/stable/)
for connecting to vdi nodes, probably very much NCI specific. Still incomplete.

Currently supports:

- Launching/terminating sessions on VDI
- Finding out hostname of a current job
- Connecting to jupyter notebook on vdi

TODO:

- vnc tunnel setup

## Installing

Requires python 3.5 or higher, also need to have `pip` installed.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/Kirill888/nci-tools.git
```

On Ubuntu might have to use `sudo pip3` instead of just `pip`, to install without `sudo` and without virtual env use `pip3 install --user ...`. To get `pip3` on Ubuntu do `sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip`

Alternatively clone then install:

```
git clone https://github.com/Kirill888/nci-tools.git
cd nci-tools
pip install .
```

If using `conda` make sure to activate your environment of choice.

## SSH Authentication

It is recommended to use ssh key-based authentication in conjunction with
*ssh-agent* for managing encrypted keys. However if you don't have this set up,
you can still connect using password based authentication, unless you supply
`--no-ask` you will be asked to enter password (this works for both password
based authentication and for password protected ssh keys if you don't use ssh
agent).

On Windows [Putty Authentication Agent](https://winscp.net/eng/docs/ui_pageant)
is consulted for public keys.

You can supply user name on a command line, but it's probably best to put it
into your ssh configuration file `$HOME/.ssh/config` like so

```
Host raijin.nci.org.au
User your-nci-user-name

Host vdi.nci.org.au
User your-nci-user-name
```

## Launch notebook on PBS

There is an example launch script for a jupyter notebook in scripts
folder [scripts/nb_launcher_qsub.sh](scripts/nb_launcher_qsub.sh). You probably
want to tweak `#PBS -l mem=` parameter depending on what you are doing. Submit
the job with `qsub` on raijin wait for it to start, then connect from your PC
with `nbconnect raijin.nci.org.au`.


## Autostart notebook server on VDI

Let's configure vdi nodes to start jupyter notebook on startup. There is a
script in `scripts` folder [setup_auto_start.sh](scripts/setup_auto_start.sh).
After running the script above on VDI node you should be able to restart vdi job
and connect to a running notebook server.

```bash
vdi terminate
vdi launch
sleep 5
vdi nbconnect
```

Note that when connecting to notebook on VDI you should use `vdi nbconnect`
instead of just `nbconnect`, this is because there is an extra step of figuring
out what host your VDI job is running on that `vdi nbconnect` does for you.
